# Chessers V2
**started on 08/08/2024 (23:58)**

Actually, I'm just trying to reorganize and rewrite some scripts.
When I'll be stuck by my old code, I'll redo entirelly the Project.
So if tomorrow you see that the repository is empty, don't worry. I just got *stuck with a bug* and decided to delet my whole project so I can redo it **better** ! :)


<u>My goals for the V2 :</u></br>
> -> Use API
> -> add asynchronous programing</br>
> -> optimize / refactor scripts</br>
> -> make a better structur</br>
> -> use my new knowledge</br>
> -> Make a better AI algortihm ! (again...)</br>

Chessers is a project made in Python</br>
It's my first big project which uses OOP
